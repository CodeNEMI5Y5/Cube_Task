# Cube_Task
Manipulation of Cube in 3D space, and adding in game timer and check. 


This project uses arrow keys to rotate cube in 3D space. You can press the Spacebar button to increase size of Cube. Leaving the spacebar will decrease it NOT below size (1,1,1) in Vector3 Space. There is a manually controlled ingame timer to show countdown timer, elapsed time, and ingame check. 

- Scripts are in the folder "Instructor Task One".
